<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Pavel</h1>
<h3 align="center">An aspiring web developer from Berlin</h3>

👨‍💻 I am a web developer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, React, Mithril JS, SASS, Webpack, Jest. I am passionate about creating clean, maintainable, and scalable code that solves real-world problems.

🎓 I completed Ironhack's 10-week web development bootcamp in Berlin in August '22, where I gained a strong foundation in the MERN stack. Since then, I have continued to learn and improve, and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skill set.

🎯 My goal is to become a versatile developer who is proficient in both front-end and back-end development. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

⚓ With a background in ship navigation, I bring a strong sense of responsibility, leadership, and teamwork to everything I do. I thrive under pressure and am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that projects are delivered on time and to the highest standard.

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not coding, you can find me lifting weights, cooking up delicious meals, or taking long walks to clear my mind and recharge my batteries.

Currently I'm doing most of my coding on my work GitHub account.
